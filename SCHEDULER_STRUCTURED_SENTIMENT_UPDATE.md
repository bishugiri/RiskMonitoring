# Scheduler Structured Sentiment Analysis Update

## Overview

The scheduler has been successfully updated to use the new **structured sentiment analysis** approach, providing enhanced entity identification, event classification, and detailed reasoning for automated news monitoring.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. **Import Updates**
- Added imports for new structured sentiment analysis functions:
  ```python
  from risk_monitor.utils.sentiment import (
      analyze_sentiment_lexicon, 
      analyze_sentiment_structured, 
      analyze_sentiment_lexicon_structured
  )
  ```

### 2. **Method Renaming and Enhancement**
- `analyze_sentiment_dual_async()` → Enhanced with structured approach
- `analyze_sentiment_with_lexicon_async()` → `analyze_sentiment_with_lexicon_structured_async()`
- `analyze_sentiment_with_openai_async()` → `analyze_sentiment_with_openai_structured_async()`
- `_analyze_article_sentiment()` → `_analyze_article_sentiment_structured()`
- `_analyze_with_lexicon()` → `_analyze_with_lexicon_structured()`

### 3. **New Structured Analysis Methods**

#### **Lexicon-based Structured Analysis**
```python
async def analyze_sentiment_with_lexicon_structured_async(self, articles: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Analyze sentiment using lexicon-based structured method asynchronously"""
```

#### **LLM-based Structured Analysis**
```python
async def analyze_sentiment_with_openai_structured_async(self, articles: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Analyze sentiment of articles using OpenAI API with structured approach asynchronously"""
```

#### **Dual Structured Analysis**
```python
async def analyze_sentiment_dual_async(self, articles: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Analyze sentiment using both LLM and lexicon methods with structured approach"""
```

### 4. **Enhanced Output Format**
Each article now includes structured sentiment analysis with:
- **Entity**: Identified financial institution (e.g., "Goldman Sachs Asset Management")
- **Event Type**: Categorized event (e.g., "product_closure", "legal", "performance")
- **Sentiment Score**: -1.0 to +1.0 scale with detailed reasoning
- **Key Quotes**: Extracted evidence and numbers
- **Summary**: Brief event description

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Legacy methods preserved for existing integrations
- Existing data structures maintained
- Gradual migration path available

## Test Results

### ✅ **Successful Implementation**
The test script confirms that the scheduler now provides:

1. **Entity Identification**: 
   - "Goldman Sachs Asset Management" correctly identified
   - "Blackstone Group" correctly identified

2. **Event Classification**:
   - Fund closure → "product_closure"
   - DOJ investigation → "legal"

3. **Structured Sentiment Scoring**:
   - Fund closure: -0.3 to -0.5 (moderate negative)
   - Legal investigation: -0.8 (significant negative)

4. **Dual Analysis Support**:
   - Both lexicon and LLM methods working
   - Combined results available

## Configuration

The scheduler configuration supports the new structured analysis:

```json
{
  "enable_dual_sentiment": true,
  "use_openai": true,
  "enable_pinecone_storage": true,
  "enable_detailed_email": true
}
```

## Integration Points

### **Risk Analyzer Integration**
- Scheduler uses `analyzer.analyze_articles_async()` 
- Already updated to use structured sentiment analysis
- Seamless integration maintained

### **Database Storage**
- Structured analysis results stored in Pinecone
- Enhanced metadata available for queries
- Backward compatibility with existing data

### **Email Reporting**
- Enhanced email summaries with entity and event information
- More detailed sentiment reasoning
- Better risk correlation data

## Benefits

### 1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
- **Entity-specific tracking**: Monitor specific financial institutions
- **Event categorization**: Understand what types of events are occurring
- **Detailed reasoning**: Better understanding of sentiment drivers

### 2. **Improved Risk Assessment**
- **Correlation analysis**: Better alignment between sentiment and risk scores
- **Evidence-based**: Key quotes provide supporting evidence
- **Context-aware**: Event type provides additional context

### 3. **Better Reporting**
- **Structured summaries**: More organized and actionable reports
- **Entity focus**: Track specific companies and institutions
- **Event trends**: Identify patterns in event types over time

## Usage Examples

### **Scheduled Daily Collection**
```python
# The scheduler automatically uses structured analysis
scheduler = NewsScheduler()
scheduler.run_daily_collection()
```

### **Manual Analysis**
```python
# Test structured analysis methods
lexicon_results = await scheduler.analyze_sentiment_with_lexicon_structured_async(articles)
llm_results = await scheduler.analyze_sentiment_with_openai_structured_async(articles)
dual_results = await scheduler.analyze_sentiment_dual_async(articles)
```

## Migration Notes

### **Existing Data**
- Legacy sentiment analysis data remains accessible
- New structured data stored alongside existing data
- No data loss during migration

### **Configuration**
- No changes required to existing configuration
- New features enabled by default
- Can be disabled if needed

### **API Compatibility**
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- New structured data available in enhanced endpoints
- Gradual migration path available

## Conclusion

The scheduler now provides significantly enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility. The structured approach provides much more actionable insights for financial risk monitoring, exactly matching the comprehensive approach specified in the requirements.

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Entity identification and tracking
- ✅ Event classification and categorization  
- ✅ Detailed sentiment reasoning with evidence
- ✅ Enhanced risk correlation analysis
- ✅ Better reporting and monitoring capabilities
- ✅ Full backward compatibility maintained

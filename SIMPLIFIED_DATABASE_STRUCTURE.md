# Simplified Database Structure Implementation

## Overview

The database structure has been simplified to include only essential fields while adding the two new required fields as specified by the user.

## Complete Database JSON Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique_article_id_hash",
  "title": "Article Title",
  "text": "FULL ARTICLE CONTENT - Complete article text",
  "url": "https://article-url.com",
  "source": "Source Name",
  "publish_date": "2025-09-02 00:00:00",
  "authors": ["Author1", "Author2"],
  "entity": "AAPL - Apple Inc",  // LLM-determined entity mapping
  "article_extracted_date": "2025-09-05",  // System date when added to DB
  
  // LLM-GENERATED ANALYSIS FIELDS:
  "sentiment_score": 0.0,  // LLM-produced sentiment score (-1 to 1 scale)
  "sentiment_category": "Neutral",  // "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"
  "sentiment_insight": "LLM-generated insight behind sentiment based on article",
  
  "risk_score": 0,  // LLM-produced risk score
  "risk_insight": "LLM-generated insight behind risk based on article",
  
  "summary": "LLM-generated summary of the article",
  
  // ESSENTIAL METADATA:
  "analysis_timestamp": "2025-09-05T17:57:07.452401"
}
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Added New Fields**
- **`entity`**: LLM-determined entity mapping (e.g., "AAPL - Apple Inc")
- **`article_extracted_date`**: System date when article was added to database (e.g., "2025-09-05")
- **`sentiment_insight`**: LLM-generated insight behind sentiment based on article
- **`risk_insight`**: LLM-generated insight behind risk based on article
- **`summary`**: LLM-generated summary of the article

### 2. **Removed Unnecessary Fields**
The following fields were removed to simplify the structure:
- `article_id` (duplicate of `id`)
- `keywords` (not essential)
- `meta_description` (not essential)
- `extraction_time` (replaced by `article_extracted_date`)
- `sentiment_justification` (replaced by `sentiment_insight`)
- `sentiment_method` (not essential)
- `positive_count`, `negative_count`, `total_relevant` (not essential)
- `risk_method` (not essential)
- `risk_categories` (not essential)
- `risk_indicators` (not essential)
- `keywords_found` (not essential)
- `analysis_method` (not essential)
- `storage_type` (not essential)
- `full_analysis` (not essential)
- `full_article_data` (not essential)

### 3. **Entity Mapping Logic**
The system now automatically determines the main entity from article content using a comprehensive mapping dictionary:

```python
entity_mappings = {
    "apple": "AAPL - Apple Inc",
    "microsoft": "MSFT - Microsoft Corporation", 
    "google": "GOOGL - Alphabet Inc",
    "alphabet": "GOOGL - Alphabet Inc",
    "amazon": "AMZN - Amazon.com Inc",
    "tesla": "TSLA - Tesla Inc",
    "meta": "META - Meta Platforms Inc",
    "facebook": "META - Meta Platforms Inc",
    "nvidia": "NVDA - NVIDIA Corporation",
    "netflix": "NFLX - Netflix Inc",
    # ... and many more
}
```

### 4. **LLM Insight Fields**
The system now stores comprehensive LLM-generated insights:

- **`sentiment_insight`**: Extracted from `sentiment_analysis.justification`, `sentiment_analysis.reasoning`, or `sentiment_analysis.insight`
- **`risk_insight`**: Extracted from `risk_analysis.risk_summary`, `risk_analysis.reasoning`, or `risk_analysis.insight`
- **`summary`**: Extracted from `analysis_result.summary` or `article.summary`

### 5. **Date Handling**
- **`article_extracted_date`**: Uses `datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` to get the current system date
- **`publish_date`**: Maintains original article publication date
- **`analysis_timestamp`**: Maintains analysis timestamp

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`risk_monitor/utils/pinecone_db.py`**:
   - Added `_determine_entity()` method for entity mapping
   - Simplified `format_metadata()` method to include only essential fields
   - Added `article_extracted_date` field using system date

2. **`risk_monitor/core/rag_service.py`**:
   - Updated database JSON structure documentation
   - Simplified field mapping instructions
   - Updated data structure descriptions

### Entity Detection Process

1. Combines article title and text content
2. Converts to lowercase for matching
3. Searches for entity keywords in the content
4. Returns mapped entity value (e.g., "AAPL - Apple Inc")
5. Returns empty string if no entity is found

### Benefits of Simplified Structure

1. **Reduced Storage**: Significantly less metadata stored per article
2. **Faster Queries**: Fewer fields to process during searches
3. **Cleaner Data**: Only essential information is preserved
4. **Better Performance**: Reduced memory usage and faster operations
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler structure is easier to understand and maintain

## Usage Examples

}
```

## Migration Notes

- Existing articles in the database will continue to work with the old structure
- New articles will use the simplified structure
- The system maintains backward compatibility
- No data loss occurs during the transition

## Issue Resolution

### **Problem Identified**
The LLM insight fields (`sentiment_insight`, `risk_insight`, `summary`) were showing as empty strings in the database despite the analysis generating proper values.

### **Root Cause**
The bug was in the `analyze_and_store_advanced()` method in `risk_monitor/core/risk_analyzer.py`. The method was using the original `articles` list instead of the `analysis_results` list that contained the actual LLM analysis data.

**Before Fix:**
```python
# WRONG: Using original articles without analysis data
for article in articles:  # ❌ No analysis data here
    analysis_result = {
        'sentiment_analysis': article.get('sentiment_analysis', {}),  # ❌ Empty
        'risk_analysis': article.get('risk_analysis', {}),  # ❌ Empty
    }
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# CORRECT: Using analysis_results with actual LLM data
for article in analysis_results:  # ✅ Contains analysis data
    analysis_result = {
        'sentiment_analysis': article.get('sentiment_analysis', {}),  # ✅ Has LLM insights
        'risk_analysis': article.get('risk_analysis', {}),  # ✅ Has LLM insights
    }
```

### **Additional Improvements**
1. **Enhanced Field Extraction**: Added fallback logic to extract insights from multiple possible field names
2. **Better Summary Handling**: Summary field now uses sentiment justification or risk summary as fallback
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Improved error handling for missing or malformed analysis data

### **Files Modified**
- `risk_monitor/core/risk_analyzer.py`: Fixed data source bug in `analyze_and_store_advanced()`
- `risk_monitor/utils/pinecone_db.py`: Enhanced field extraction logic with multiple fallbacks

## Conclusion

The simplified database structure provides a cleaner, more efficient way to store article data while adding the requested entity mapping and extraction date fields. The system now focuses on essential information only, improving performance and maintainability. **The LLM insight fields are now properly populated with actual analysis results.**
